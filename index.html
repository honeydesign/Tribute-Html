            Murtala Ramat Muhammed 8 November 1938 – 13 February 1976) he was a
            Nigerian general who led the 1966 Nigerian counter-coup in
            overthrowing the Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi military regime and featured
            prominently during the Nigerian Civil War and thereafter ruled over
            Nigeria from 29 July 1975 until his assassination on 13 February
            1976.[6] This period in Nigerian history, from the Northern
            counter-coup victory to Murtala's death, is commonly associated with
            the institutionalization of the military in politics. Born in Kano,
            into a ruling-class religious family, Murtala served in the Nigerian
            Army as a cadet in the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. He later
            served in Congo; eventually rose through the ranks to become
            brigadier general in 1971, aged 33, becoming one of the youngest
            generals in Nigeria.

    <h2 id="career">Early Career</h2>
    <p>
      Murtala Muhammed joined the Nigerian Army in 1958. He spent short training
      stints in Nigeria and Ghana and then was trained as an officer cadet at
      Sandhurst Royal Military Academy in England.[16] After his training, he
      was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1961 and assigned to the
      Nigerian Army Signals that same year, later spending a short stint with
      the No. 3 Brigade Signals Troop in Congo.[15] In 1962, Muhammed was
      appointed aide-de-camp to M. A. Majekodunmi, the federally-appointed
      administrator of the Western Region. In 1963, he became the
      officer-in-charge of the First Brigade Signal Troop in Kaduna,
      Nigeria.[citation needed] That year he traveled to the Royal Corps of
      Signals at Catterick Garrison, England for a course on advanced
      telecommunications techniques. On his return to Nigeria in 1964, he was
      promoted to major and appointed officer-commanding, 1st Signal Squadron in
      Apapa, Lagos. In November 1965, he was made acting Chief of Signals of the
      Army, while his paternal uncle, Inuwa Wada had recently been appointed
      Defense Minister.

      Between 1970 and 1971, he attended the Joint Service Staff College in
      England, his supervisor's report attributed him to having ''a quick agile
      mind, considerable ability and common sense.[20] He holds strong views
      which he puts forward in a forthright manner. He is a strong character and
      determined. However, he finds it difficult to moderate his opinions and
      finds it difficult to enter into debate with others whose views he may not
      share''.[15] After the war, he was promoted to brigadier-general in
      October 1971. Between 1971 and 1974, Muhammed was involved in routine
      activities within the signals unit of the army. However, he also disagreed
      with some of the policies being pursued by Gowon. On 7 August 1974, the
      head of state, General Yakubu Gowon appointed him as the new Federal
      Commissioner for Communications, which he combined with his military
      duties as Inspector of Signals at the Army Signals Headquarters in Apapa,
      Lagos.[21] On 7 August 1974, General Yakubu Gowon appointed Muhammed as
      the Federal commissioner (position now called Minister) for communications
      to oversee and facilitate the nation's development of cost effective
      communication infrastructures during the oil boom.[22] After the war and
      after he took power as head of state, Muhammed started the reorganization
      and demobilization of 100,000 troops from the armed forces. The number of
      troops in the armed forces decreased from 250,000 to 150,000.[23]

      On 29 July 1975, General Yakubu Gowon was overthrown while attending the
      12th summit of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in Kampala, Uganda.
      Muhammed took power as the new Military Head of State.[24] Brigadiers
      Obasanjo (later Lt. General) and Danjuma (later Lt. General) were
      appointed as Chief of Staff, Supreme HQ and Chief of Army Staff,
      respectively. Charisma In the coup d'état that brought him to power he
      introduced the phrases "Fellow Nigerians" and "with immediate effect" to
      the national lexicon.[25] In a short time, Murtala Muhammed's policies won
      him broad popular support, and his decisiveness elevated him to the status
      of a folk hero.[26] However his highly popular, often televised "with
      immediate effect" style of governing, also gained some criticism amongst
      the countries top civil servants - some of which were Nigeria’s top
      intellectuals.[27] His ad-hoc Presidential proclamations left his civil
      service often unprepared, lacking details or even funding to implement his
      ideas, and his administration led to the dismissal of thousands of civil
      servants.[27] Over 10,000 civil servants, government employees were
      dismissed without benefits; reasons stated were age, health, incompetence,
      or malpractice. The removal of such a large amount of public officials
      affected the public service, the judiciary, the police and armed forces,
      the diplomatic service, public corporations, and university officials.
      Quite a few officials were tried on corruption charges, and an ex-military
      state governor was executed for gross office misconduct.[28] National
      federalism Muhammed took federal control of the country's two largest
      newspapers – Daily Times and New Nigerian; all media in Nigeria was now
      under federal control. He also took federal control of the remaining
      state-run universities.[29] On February 3, 1976, the Military Government
      of Murtala Muhammed created new states and renamed others, the states he
      created include: Bauchi, Benue, Borno, Imo, Niger, Ogun, and Ondo.[30]
      This brought the total number of states in Nigeria to nineteen in 1976. As
      head of state, Muhammed put in place plans to build a new Federal Capital
      Territory due to Lagos being overcrowded. He set up a panel headed by
      Justice Akinola Aguda, which chose the Abuja area as the new capital ahead
      of other proposed locations. On 3 February 1976, Muhammed announced that
      the Federal Capital would in the future move to a federal territory
      location of about 8,000 square kilometres in the central part of the
      country.[29] Towards the end of 1975, the administration implemented a
      mass purge in the Nigerian civil service. The civil service was viewed as
      undisciplined and lacking a sense of purpose. A retrenchment exercise was
      implemented as part of a strategy to refocus the service. However, because
      of the drastic nature of the purge, allegations that malice and revenge
      was used by heads of department in recommending people for retrenchment
      surfaced, and little was done to scrutinize the details and reasons staff
      were disengaged.[15] Economic policy As head of state Murtala Muhammed
      inherited an immense amount of oil and petroleum resources and enormous
      but untapped natural gas reserves. But in 1975, Muhammed saw reduced
      revenue due to low levels of petroleum production; this meant that the
      military government lacked the projected funds to meet Nigeria's
      development plan for 1975. The decline in petroleum production in 1975 was
      due to a global fall in demand, high costs of spare parts and high labour
      costs.[31]

    <h2 id="assassination">Assassination</h2>
    <p>
      On 13 February 1976, General Muhammed set off for work along his usual
      route on George Street. Shortly after 8 a.m., his Mercedes Benz car
      traveled slowly in the infamous Lagos traffic near the Federal Secretariat
      at Ikoyi in Lagos and a group of soldiers (members of an abortive coup led
      by Dimka) emerged from an adjacent petrol station, ambushed the vehicle
      and assassinated Muhammed.[32] Murtala Muhammed was killed, aged 37, along
      with his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Akintunde Akinsehinwa, in his black
      Mercedes Benz saloon car on 13 February 1976. The car was ambushed en
      route to his office at Dodan Barracks, Lagos. The only visible sign of
      protection was a pistol carried by his orderly, making his assassination
      an easy task. The assassination was part of an attempted coup led by Lt.
      Col Buka Suka Dimka, he was executed on 15 May 1976[33] at the Kirikiri
      Maximum Security Prison in Lagos for treason.[34] He was succeeded by the
      Chief of Staff, Supreme HQ Olusegun Obasanjo, who completed his plan of an
      orderly transfer to civilian rule by handing power to Shehu Shagari on 1
      October 1979. Today, Muhammed's portrait adorns the 20 Naira note and
      Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos is named in his
      honour.[35]
